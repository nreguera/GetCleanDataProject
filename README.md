The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

After the files generation, it has been taken a process to make all these data tidy and ordered for analysis. For so, in this script it has been group all the information by activity and subject and then added another column to have a mean of the values and in this way perform the needed extraction of information.

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Name of the activity carried out.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. 
- A label of the feature measured. 
- The mean value of the feature measured.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'dataset.txt': File with the mean of each feature meaasured related with mean and standar deviation, result of the experiment, group by activity and subject.

- 'Codebook.md': a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

- 'run_analysis.R.txt': Script with the code to clean up the original dataset.

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
